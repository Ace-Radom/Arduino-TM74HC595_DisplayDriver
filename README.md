# Arduino-TM74HC595_DisplayDriver

整个驱动皆在Arduino Uno板上完成开发 并目前仅仅在Uno板上完成测试【因为我手头没有像Mega或者Nano等别的开发板】

The whole program is based on Arduino Uno Board, and was only tested on this type of Arduino Board, because sadly I don't have any other type of boards, such as Mega or Nano.

目前有计划去买一块Mega 2560开发板自用但……尚未确定 等真的入手了会第一时间在上面测试这个驱动【虽然我自己不觉得会出什么问题】

I have the plan to buy a Mega 2560 board on my own, but now it's just a plan. When I get it I'll test this Driver on the Mega board although I don't think it'll go wrong.

For users who don't speak chinese: I must say that my native language is chinese, that's why all the comments in the program are in my native language because it's much easier for me. After the V1.0 release I'll try my best to translate the comments by myself. (Actually I can speak chinese, english and German)
